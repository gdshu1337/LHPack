# LHPack
Welcome! The LHPack is a Minecraft resource pack licensed under the public domain, created by gdshu1337 (@meifwong1006). Everything is made by me and you can copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute them in any form, any way, any time, anywhere and by any means, and with or without attribution.

LHPack adds extra trains and signs to the Minecraft Transit Railway mod (https://github.com/jonafanho/Minecraft-Transit-Railway), all made and designed by gdshu1337 (me). Please install the mod into the game first before using this pack. My apologies for my terrible creations, and I periodically remake old things.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy! The LHPack would not be possible without the generous contribution of the following people:
- Thanks JeffreyWong0707 for several design ideas
- Thanks MakeHistory068 for parts of your textures and helping with some of my train designs
